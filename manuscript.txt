Slide 1.
Now we start on general relativity. As seen a tackyon can move faster than light, and therefore also arrive before it left.
According to special relativity, a tachyon can move faster than light and therefore arrive before it comes back. Tackyons have never been seen. What about gravity. Accoring to Newton, gravity spreads out instantaniously. But according to special relativity, this would mean that cause came before effect in another system. This should not be possible. That was why Einstin though that a new theory of gravity was needed, and as we all know he came of with what today is known as the general theory of relativity.
In 1907 Einstein had what he himself described as the happiest thought of his life. If someone is in free fall, then no forces are acting on it. Is there then any difference between being in an accelerated elevator (or accelerated reference system) in space and being in a gravitational field. 
This was a sort of extension on what had been long known that two masses would fall with the same accelration, this was shown already in the 1700th centery by Galileo. This is known as the weak eqvivalence principle.

Slide 2
That gravity can be described as just accelration can only be true locally.
Lets assume you have an enourmesly large labratorium in space out in the atmosphere of Mars. If your lab is large enough you will notice a difference.
Consider what happens if you drop two balls. They will both fall towards the center of Mars. If your lab is large enough it will look like a force is pulling them towards eachother.
Lets take the two balls back to earth, and let us also imagine that the world is a perfect sphere and frictionless. Then take the two balls to the equatior two places far apart from eachother, for instance Brazil and Kenya. If you throw the ballsin a straight line aiming at the north pole they will follow the the longitudional lines. This means that locally they will follow straight lines, but as seen from space it looks like they are gravitating towards eachother. 
This realizaition motivated the describing gravity as a geometrical effect. 


Slide 3


The metric of a geometry can be though of as a function that describes how to find the shortest way between two points in that geometry. This function is the input to the geodesic equation that describes the geodesics, that means the shortest way between different
