Slide 1.
Now we start on general relativity. As seen a tackyon can move faster than light, and therefore also arrive before it left.
According to special relativity, a tachyon can move faster than light and therefore arrive before it comes back. Tackyons have never been seen. What about gravity. Accoring to Newton, gravity spreads out instantaniously. But according to special relativity, this would mean that cause came before effect in another system. This should not be possible. That was why Einstin though that a new theory of gravity was needed, and as we all know he came of with what today is known as the general theory of relativity.
In 1907 Einstein had what he himself described as the happiest thought of his life. If someone is in free fall, then no forces are acting on it. Is there then any difference between being in an accelerated elevator (or accelerated reference system) in space and being in a gravitational field. 
This was a sort of extension on what had been long known that two masses would fall with the same accelration, this was shown already in the 1700th centery by Galileo. This is known as the weak eqvivalence principle.
